# Leetcode Solutions in Go

This is a personal repository for doing and tracking Leetcode problems in Golang. You can use this yourself, but be sure to delete the problems under the `/solutions` folder for yourself. Also run `rm -rf .git` in the root of this project to disassociate my git remote.
		
To compile helper cli's (to quickly start/track new problems):
	
```
make init
``` 

To start a new problem:	
```
./new <problem id>
``` 

To mark a problem as complete:	
``` 
./done <problem id>
```
